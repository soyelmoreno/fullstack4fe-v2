# Simple Hello World app server

Working through Frontend Masters course: "Full Stack for Frontend Engineers, v2"
by Jem Young https://frontendmasters.com/courses/fullstack-v2/

Course slides are shared with me: [Full Stack for Front-End
v2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Mvf_rOFz1wZeH1irajJqhRQgzid7BkqJBd8wigpz39M/edit)

Content from slides (commands and code) are in [this file](slides.md).

The main app here is `app.js`, which is just a tiny Node server app that returns
a simple text response when you navigate to "/" of some domain.

Mostly I'm using this repo to practice deploying a Node app to an Nginx web
server.

## Chatbot app

There is a small chatbot app in this repo as well. The code for it was copied
from a repo that Jem Young owns: https://github.com/young/fsfev2

He created the starting point for the simple chatbot app and told us about it in
the course "Full Stack for Front-End Engineers v2".

I put it in this repo along with the super basic Hello World app server. I also
added a few styles.
